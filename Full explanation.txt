People have found a way to get abnormal stat modes such as stat mode 0.
To get this mode you have to press [mode] [2] then [ac] after about 0.5 seconds you press on if you did it correctly you will see reg at the top indicators and when you press [shift] [1] you will see reg.
With this you can exploit these symbols.
Why this is possible is because you have overwritten the eeprom and caused it to set the stat mode to 0 instead of 1....8.
The calculator then sets the pointers of these symbols to incorrect pieces of code.

what we can do with these is spell and do random things.

An example of this is the Pol(b project which is unfinished but if you look at the 5*9 to 5*6 coversion you will be able to figure it out.
To do single line spelling you press [shift] [1] [5] [1] then type your 7-12 character ascii then 9x[)] pressing equals will run this code and you will see the the letter "a" and the characters you typed with the trailing bracets.
When you press on you will be in mode 68 which is useful as to performing basic overflow in mathio.

another thing you can do is r based hackstings. to do these you use [shift] [1] [5] [3] then behind it you type 4x([(](any 4 digit number)) and then press equals.
You can try different amounts of numbeers and lengths and even changing where you put r. using [m+] or [sto]+{var} can change the affects like (4343(4343(4343(4343r->Ma causes mass curruption.

Now in comp mathio you can get "r" to do this you press [pol] [1] [,] [0] [=] [/] [9] ([)] until you cant type any more) [=] [ac] [up] [ac] [left] delete all the other stuff apart from r and do some more hackstrings. 
Hackstrings that involve "9" often can be used to change the mode such as (7979(7979(7979(7979r changes the mode to vector which sadly has no functionality.

Now in stat mode 0 type (1(1(1(1r then [=] [on] then type [V(](square root) [1] [=] [shift] [mode] [2] [up] delete the square root and change it to [log(] then after the bold "B" type 2 then [=] [shift] [mode] [1] [1] [up] now you have log with parameters.
This can probably be used to perform adnvanced overflow.
